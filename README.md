WARNING: the generation use the whole available space of the browser window, meaning if you have a 1440p or a 4K monitor it may take a while to render, try first in a smaller window, also use the step mode to see how many iterations you can reach before giving up, the computation does not freeze the browser though, you can stop it any time by closing the tab or refreshing the page
